# Data Entry Feature Improvement Plan & Checklist\n\n
## Goals\n
1. **Persistence:** Data entered in fields must persist locally and only be uploaded to the online DHIS2 instance when explicitly saved by the user.\n
2. **Explicit Save & Feedback:** The Save FAB persists data locally and attempts upload if online, providing clear user feedback (progress, success, offline, or error).\n
3. **Save Confirmation on Navigation:** The unsaved changes dialog only appears if there are unsaved changes and the Save FAB has not been pressed or is not in progress.\n
4. **Section Integrity:** Data fields remain in their correct section after entry.\n
5. **Field Count:** Each accordion section displays a count of fields with data entered.\n
6. **Synchronization:** Sync is handled only in the Dataset Instances screen, using DHIS2 SDK sync/upload methods. Sync first pushes local data, then pulls from the server, with user feedback.\n
7. **Offline Support & Network Awareness:** All online operations check for connectivity. If offline, uploads/syncs are queued and user is informed. Retry and error feedback are provided.\n\n---\n\n
## Checklist\n\n### 
1. Persistence & Explicit Save\n- [ ] ViewModel state is updated immediately on user input (local draft).\n- [ ] State is not reset or reloaded unnecessarily on navigation.\n- [ ] State restoration when returning to Edit Entry screen.\n- [ ] Data is only uploaded to DHIS2 when Save FAB is pressed.\n- [ ] Save FAB shows progress indicator while saving.\n- [ ] On save: show feedback (success, offline, or error).\n- [ ] Remove any auto-upload or auto-save to backend on field change.\n\n### 
2. Save Confirmation on Navigation\n- [ ] Detect navigation away with unsaved changes.\n- [ ] Show dialog only if Save not pressed/in progress: \"You have unsaved changes. Save before leaving? [Save] [Discard] [Cancel]\".\n- [ ] If [Save], persist all data (upload if online, else queue for sync).\n- [ ] If [Discard], clear all unsaved values (local drafts).\n- [ ] If [Cancel], remain on Edit Entry screen.\n\n### 
3. Section Integrity\n- [ ] Data fields remain in their original section after editing.\n- [ ] Prevent logic that moves fields to a \"default\" section upon value change.\n\n### 
4. Field Count\n- [ ] Count of non-empty fields per section in accordion header.\n\n### 
5. Synchronization (Dataset Instances Screen Only)\n- [ ] Remove sync icon from Edit Entry screen.\n- [ ] Sync icon in Dataset Instances screen only.\n- [ ] On sync: push all local data, then pull updates from server (using DHIS2 SDK methods).\n- [ ] User feedback (Snackbar/dialog) on sync success/failure.\n- [ ] Show sync status for each instance (pending, synced, error).\n\n### 
6. Offline Support & Network Awareness\n- [ ] Check for network connectivity before online operations.\n- [ ] If offline, queue uploads/sync for later and inform user.\n- [ ] All data entry and local persistence works offline.\n- [ ] User feedback when offline/online status changes.\n- [ ] Retry options for failed uploads.\n\n### 
7. General\n- [ ] Avoid unnecessary file/folder creation.\n- [ ] Keep code changes concise and precise.\n- [ ] Consult official documentation for Compose, ViewModel, and DHIS2 SDK as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Progress Log\n- Checklist updated to reflect best practices for save/upload flow, user feedback, and robust online/offline handling.
