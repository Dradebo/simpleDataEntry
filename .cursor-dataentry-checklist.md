 # Data Entry Feature Improvement Plan & Checklist\n\n
 ## Goals\n
 1. **Persistence:** Data entered in fields must persist when navigating between accordion sections and when leaving/re-entering the Edit Entry screen.\n
 2. **Section Integrity:** Data fields must remain in their correct section after entry; no field should move to a new \"default\" section upon editing.\n
 3. **Field Count:** Each accordion section should display a count of fields with data entered.\n
 4. **Explicit Save:** Data is only stored (persisted to the repository/backend) when the user taps the floating action button (FAB) with the save icon.\n\n---\n\n
 ## Checklist\n\n### 
 1. Persistence\n- [ ] Ensure ViewModel state is updated immediately on user input (optimistic update).\n- [ ] Ensure ViewModel state is not reset or reloaded unnecessarily on accordion navigation or screen navigation.\n- [ ] Ensure state restoration when returning to the Edit Entry screen.\n\n### 
 2. Section Integrity\n- [ ] Ensure data fields remain in their original section after editing.\n- [ ] Prevent any logic that moves fields to a \"default\" section upon value change.\n\n### 
 3. Field Count\n- [ ] Implement a count of non-empty fields per section.\n- [ ] Display this count in the accordion header for each section.\n\n### 
 4. Explicit Save (FAB)\n- [ ] Add a floating action button with a save icon to the Edit Entry screen.\n- [ ] On FAB tap, persist all current data values in the ViewModel state to the repository/backend.\n- [ ] Provide user feedback (e.g., Snackbar) on save success/failure.\n\n### 
 5. General\n- [ ] Avoid unnecessary file/folder creation.\n- [ ] Keep all code changes concise and precise.\n- [ ] Consult official documentation for Compose, ViewModel, and DHIS2 SDK as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Progress Log\n- Checklist created and file added to .gitignore.
