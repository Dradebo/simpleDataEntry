## About

A simple, robust Android app for entering, validating, and managing DHIS2 data values in the field or at the facility. Designed for ease of use, **true offline support**, and seamless integration with DHIS2 instances specifically for a data entrant at a facility.

---

## Features

- **Offline-First Architecture:**
  - All metadata (datasets, data elements, category combos, option combos, org units) and data drafts are cached in a local Room database.
  - The app always loads from Room first for instant, robust offline use.
  - After login/sync, the app hydrates its Room cache from the DHIS2 SDK.
  - The app only fetches from the DHIS2 SDK/server if Room is empty and the device is online.
- **Datasets Listing:**
  - View available datasets for the logged-in user and organization unit.
- **Data Entries Listing:**
  - View available data entries for the logged-in user and organization unit.
  - See last updated dates and attribute option combos for each instance.
- **Create New Data Entry:**
  - Guided workflow to create a new data entry for a dataset, period, org unit, and attribute option combo.
- **Edit Existing Data Entry:**
  - Edit all data values for a dataset instance, grouped by section and category.
  - Accordion UI for easy navigation between sections and category groups.
  - Data fields support text, numbers, integers, percentages, dates, coordinates, and yes/no (boolean) types.
- **Immediate Value Persistence:**
  - Each field saves immediately as a local draft, with optimistic UI updates and error handling.
- **Validation:**
  - Built-in validation for value types (number, integer, percentage, etc.) and required fields.
- **Manual Refresh & Sync:**
  - Users can manually refresh dataset instances and data values to ensure up-to-date information.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Efficient Compose state management and Room caching for instant UI and minimal lag.
- **Error Handling:**
  - User-friendly error messages for failed saves, validation errors, and sync issues.
- **DHIS2 Integration:**
  - Uses DHIS2 Android SDK for authentication, data value management, and metadata sync.

## Architecture

This project follows a **modern Android architecture** using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern, **Jetpack Compose** for UI, **Room** for local caching, and **Hilt** for dependency injection.

- **Presentation Layer**: Composables and ViewModels (e.g., `DataEntryViewModel`, `LoginViewModel`, etc.) in `app/src/main/java/com/ash/simpledataentry/presentation/`.
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases and models in `app/src/main/java/com/ash/simpledataentry/domain/`.
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, Room DAOs/entities, and data sources in `app/src/main/java/com/ash/simpledataentry/data/`.
- **Dependency Injection**: Configured via Hilt in `di/AppModule.kt`.
- **App Initialization**: The `SimpleDataEntry` class (subclass of `Application`) initializes the DHIS2 SDK and other app-wide dependencies.

---

## Offline-First & Caching

- **Room Entities & DAOs:**
  - The app defines Room entities and DAOs for all key metadata: Datasets, Data Elements, Category Combos, Category Option Combos, Organisation Units, and Data Value Drafts.
- **Hydration from DHIS2 SDK:**
  - After login or sync, the app fetches all metadata from the DHIS2 SDK and persists it to Room.
- **Primary Data Source:**
  - All screens and repositories load from Room first for instant, offline access.
  - If Room is empty and the device is online, the app fetches from the DHIS2 SDK/server, updates Room, and then loads from Room.
- **Drafts:**
  - All data entry drafts are saved in Room and merged with metadata for offline editing and review.
- **Robust Offline Flow:**
  - Users can log in, sync, and then use the app in the field with no connectivity. All metadata and drafts are available, and the UI loads instantly.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (latest recommended)
- **JDK 11**
- **Android SDK 24+**

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/simpleDataEntry.git
   cd simpleDataEntry
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle and build the project.
4. Run on an emulator or physical device (API 24+).

---

## Configuration

- **DHIS2 Server**: The app expects DHIS2 server configuration (URL, username, password) via the `Dhis2Config` data class.
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Main activity is `com.ash.simpledataentry.presentation.MainActivity`. The app uses standard permissions and themes.
- **Dependency Injection**: All repositories and use cases are provided via Hilt modules in `di/AppModule.kt`.

---

## Usage

1. Login with your DHIS2 credentials (ensure you are online for the first login/sync).
2. The app will download and cache all required metadata and data drafts locally.
3. Select the dataset for which you want to enter data.
4. Select an existing entry you may want to edit or add to, or press the plus at the bottom right corner to create a new entry.
5. Navigate through the accordions and perform entry into the fields for which data is available.
6. You can now go offline and continue to use the app, enter data, and save drafts. All screens will load instantly from local cache.
7. When back online, sync to push drafts and fetch any new metadata or data.

---

## Development

- **Main App Module**: All code is under the `app/` directory.
- **Key files and directories**:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/ash/simpledataentry/` â€” Main package.
    - `presentation/` â€” UI screens and ViewModels.
    - `domain/` â€” Business logic, models, and use cases.
    - `data/` â€” Data sources, Room DAOs/entities, and repository implementations.
    - `di/` â€” Dependency injection setup.
    - `ui/theme/` â€” Compose theme definitions.
  - `app/build.gradle.kts` â€” App-level Gradle build file.
  - `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` â€” App manifest.

- **Build System**: Uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`).

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite covering all architectural layers with 80%+ coverage of critical functionality.

### ðŸ§ª Test Structure

- **Unit Tests** (`app/src/test/`): JVM tests for business logic
  - Domain use cases and validation services
  - ViewModels with StateFlow testing using Turbine
  - Repository implementations with mocked dependencies
  - Test data builders and utilities for consistent test data

- **Instrumentation Tests** (`app/src/androidTest/`): Android device tests
  - Room database operations with in-memory testing
  - Compose UI components and user interactions
  - Integration tests with Android context

### ðŸš€ Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, run locally)
./gradlew test

# UI/Integration tests (requires emulator/device)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# All tests
./gradlew build
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Testing Highlights

- **Modern Stack**: JUnit 4, Mockito-Kotlin, Turbine, Google Truth, Compose Testing
- **StateFlow Testing**: Proper async testing with `MainDispatcherRule` and `runTest`
- **Database Testing**: In-memory Room database for reliable DAO testing
- **UI Testing**: Compose test rule with semantic tree assertions
- **Test Coverage**: Business logic, state management, data persistence, UI interactions

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.

### ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing

Test the offline-first flow by:
1. Logging in and syncing while online
2. Going offline (disable WiFi/data)
3. Navigating all screens and entering data - should load instantly from Room cache
4. Going back online and syncing to push drafts and fetch updates
