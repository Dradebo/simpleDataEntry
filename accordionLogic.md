1. every data element has a category combination, the data elements that have default as their category combinations are the case where you can assume that it's zero categories, these need to be rendered as a flat list whether it's a section with only default or a mixed bag, they shouldn't be a nested accordion for these.
2. if the category combination is anything other than default, an examination of the category needs to be done, the category options of this category will inform the way in which the elemwnt fields will be rendered, a. if it's a gender category or a strictly two option category, then two fields will be rendered side by side for Male and Female or whatever category options are available and the labels should be clear and directly above the entry field, b. if the options are more than two then a single accordion piece with the name of the category is rendered with the elements rendered as a list within this nested accordion.
3. if the category combination has two categories then some parsing is required, the two categories are checked and a count of the options is done, the way the options are treated should be done according to point 2 detailed above. the first step is to establish if any category has more options than 2 options, these options automatically become headers of nested accordions. the other category involved will be checked and the count of options will determine the rendering paradigm, a two option category will be handled as previously described ie side by side entry fields in a row for each pair,
4. if a section has all it's elements with the same category combination, then the category combination parsing logic above should be applied in the rendering paradigm. this should be the first thing checked before any other category combination parsing.
5. If a section has a elements with different category combinations, the individual sections need to be individually checked according to the methods described above and the elements then rendered according to the rules of the category combinations they individually have ie flat list for default(zero) category combination elements and so on and so forth.
Output: Relay to me what you understand from this parsing logic I've detailed and if it makes sense, tell me how you would render the section examples I've provided in the pictures and the logcat output and if it's astute I'll want this documented to guide you and ensure you donot mess up this structure with future edits


the first thing that should happen when the sections are fetched with their data elements, all the data elements within a section are checked for the category combination, every data element has a category combination, this has to be specifically done per section, the data elements parsed must all be from a single section at a time, the data elements are then checked for their category combinations, the first thing is to determine whether all elements in a section have the same category combination, if it's the same then the category combination parsing logic detailed above is applied, if there are data elements with different category combinations in a single section, the data elements are then initially grouped by similarity of category combination, each group with a simialr category combination is treated in the same way according to intital category combination logic but this has to go in accordance with the grouping within the section, elements with a simlar category combination are treated the same way. Inspect the code and see how close or far it is from implementing this and create a comprehensive plan on how to bridge the gap


there are no entry fields for complex sections, what's happening is an accordion piece for category option combinations, you need to check online for the dhis2 aggregate data model because the rendering is still lacking, instead of 7 accordion pieces with the data element entry fields within having the gender entries side by side, there's an accordion piece for each of the 280 elements in section B, this is not what is expected, the app is as follows. Dataset -> Sections -> Dataelements -> Category combinations -> Categories -> Category options. The data entry form of a dataset is going to have either just a default section or several sections, each section will have data elements. Every data element will have a category combination. a category combination will have one or more categories. categories will have options within them, and a mix of categories will create a unique combination of all the options of the categories in the combination that will be the disaggregations and data entry fields for each data element. to see if you are able to understand what I'm alluding to, can you tell me how this factors into how the rendering logic for the accordions will work? and why it isn't working now?
