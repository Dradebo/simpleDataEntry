## 🔄 VALIDATION STRATEGY

### **DHIS2 SDK Native Implementation**
- Use `d2.validationModule().expressions().evaluate()` for expression evaluation
- Implement proper data context setup for validation rules
- Handle DHIS2 function calls (IF, MAX, MIN, etc.) through SDK
- Maintain caching for performance but rely on SDK for accuracy

### **Data Element Counter Logic**
- Count unique data elements with non-empty values
- Ignore category option combination multiplicity in count display
- Show "X of Y data elements completed" instead of field counts
- Maintain detailed field tracking internally for validation

### **Datasets Screen Specification**
**List Card Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Monthly Health Facility Report │ ← Dataset name (main text)
│ 23 entries                     │ ← Entry count subtext
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Top Bar**: Replace filter button with search/sort controls for periods and org units

### **Smooth Transition Specification**
- **Current**: Dataset Instances → Edit Entry = Immediate spinner freeze
- **Target**: Dataset Instances → Edit Entry = Smooth progressive loading (like Login → Datasets)
- Implement meaningful loading states and progress indicators

This enhanced plan builds on the solid foundation already implemented while addressing the specific user experience and technical robustness issues identified. The phased approach ensures critical functionality is addressed first while maintaining system stability throughout development.
